normal at, make it use inversed matrix insteda of calculating it 

copy transformation matrices

make light multiple sources


//how to calculate normals:
/*note:: in calculating normal we need to take the point 
and convert it to the object space so that its centered at the origin,
then we can calculate normal normally but its in object space 
and to convert it back to world space 
we need to multiply with transpose of the inversed transformation matrix*/

//t_world commented? nope

check world.c for the the color_at/draw_world

//shade_hit is where to call lighting of all light sources

abs warning?

make sure you're using is equal if youre trying to compare floats

try to understand over point a little more
